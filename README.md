# Interactive 3D Resume - Explore My World

Welcome to my Interactive 3D Resume, a unique project that blends creativity with technology to showcase my professional and personal journey in an engaging and immersive way. Modeled after my own room, this web-based application invites you to step into a virtual space where you can interact with objects that represent different aspects of my skills and experiences.

## Features
- **Interactive 3D Room:** Navigate a 3D model of a room that I designed, complete with furniture and personal artifacts.
- **Clickable Objects:** Explore clickable objects that reveal more about me:
  - **Computer:** Opens my GitHub repository showcasing projects and code snippets.
  - **Bookshelf:** Displays a list of books I've read, reflecting my interests and knowledge base.
  - **Certificates:** View my academic and professional achievements documented through various certificates.
  - **Hobbies:** Learn about my hobbies and how they influence my professional skills and personal growth.
- **Responsive Design:** Optimized for performance and accessibility on various devices and browsers.
- **User-friendly Navigation:** Simple controls for a smooth navigation experience within the 3D space.

## Technologies Used
- **Blender:** For creating detailed 3D models of the room and its contents.
- **Three.js:** To render the 3D scene in a web browser, providing an interactive experience using WebGL.
- **JavaScript/HTML/CSS:** For creating the web structure and interactive components.

## Project Goals
This project aims to provide an innovative way to present a professional portfolio in a manner that is both informative and engaging. It reflects my skills in software development, particularly in 3D modeling and web development, and my passion for blending technology with creativity.

## How to Navigate
- Use the arrow keys or WASD to move around the room.
- Click on objects to learn more about my work and experiences.

- Note: I am still working on blender to improve and integrate my 3d models in the room and will have the completed project posted on June 11 2025.
